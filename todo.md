# TODO

## For 0.2.0
- Update README with class-level settings.
- Formally interpret async true as concurrency of 1, so as not to rely on
  undocumented pasync behavior.
- Make `::run` result into more than just the best individual.
    - Update README.

## For 1.0.0
- Better error messages for async configuration mistakes.
- Post built api docs somewhere.
    - Add link to README.
