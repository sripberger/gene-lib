# TODO

## For 1.0.0
- Formally interpret async true as concurrency of 1, so as not to rely on
  undocumented pasync behavior.
- Fully implement class-level settings, not just for async like it is now.
    - Update README.
- Better error messages for async configuration mistakes.
- Make `::run` result into more than just the best individual.
    - Update README.
- Post built api docs somewhere.
    - Add link to README.
