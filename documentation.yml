# This file defines sorting of memeber documentation. Any member not listed will
# be appended to the end, in source order.

# Child items are not actually nested here. They are merely listed after each
# group name. This is a workaround, as actual nesting of TOC items is currently
# broken for html output in documentation.js.

    - name: Core Methods
